          <h2>Indian Culture</h2>
          <p>Indian culture is a rich and diverse tapestry woven from centuries of history, traditions, and influences. It is characterized by its deep spiritual roots, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism all originating in India, alongside significant populations of Muslims, Christians, and other faiths. This religious diversity is reflected in a multitude of festivals, such as Diwali, Eid, Christmas, and Vaisakhi, celebrated with fervor and joy across the country.</p>
